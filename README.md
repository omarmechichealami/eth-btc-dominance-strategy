# eth-btc-dominance-strategy

A backtested trading strategy that goes long on Ethereum when both ETH and BTC are in an uptrend, and Ethereum shows dominance over Bitcoin (ETH/BTC uptrend).

üß† Strategy Overview ‚Äî ETH/BTC Dominance

This strategy is a long-only model on Ethereum, designed to enter and exit positions based on trend strength and volume-price behavior.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Entry Conditions (all must be true)

We enter a long position on ETH only when the following three conditions are met:
	1.	Ethereum is in an uptrend
‚û§ ETH price is above its moving average
	2.	Bitcoin is in an uptrend
‚û§ BTC price is above its moving average
	3.	Ethereum is dominating Bitcoin
‚û§ The ETH/BTC ratio is in an uptrend
‚û§ Defined as a short-term moving average of ETH/BTC being above the long-term moving average

‚∏ª

‚ùå Exit Conditions (any one is enough)

We exit the ETH position if any of the following conditions occur:
	1.	ETH breaks below its moving average
‚û§ Indicates a possible trend reversal
	2.	Stop-loss is triggered at -3%
‚û§ Capital protection during unexpected drops
	3.	Volume anomaly without price movement
‚û§ ETH trading volume spikes significantly
‚û§ But the candle body is very small (suggesting weak price conviction)
‚û§ Possible sign of manipulation, exhaustion, or hidden selling pressure
