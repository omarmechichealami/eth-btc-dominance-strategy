# eth-btc-dominance-strategy

A backtested trading strategy that goes long on Ethereum when both ETH and BTC are in an uptrend, and Ethereum shows dominance over Bitcoin (ETH/BTC uptrend).

üß† Strategy Overview ‚Äî ETH/BTC Dominance

This strategy is a long-only momentum model focused on Ethereum (ETH), designed to ride strong trends while avoiding weak or manipulated market conditions. It uses Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH/BTC ratio as trend confirmation filters to increase edge and robustness.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Entry Conditions ‚Äî All Must Be True

We enter a long position on ETH only when all three of the following conditions are satisfied:
	1.	ETH is in an uptrend
‚Üí ETH price is above its own moving average (e.g. 100-period MA)
	2.	BTC is in an uptrend
‚Üí BTC price is above its own moving average (e.g. 60-period MA)
	3.	ETH is outperforming BTC (ETH is dominating)
‚Üí The ETH/BTC ratio is rising
‚Üí Specifically, a short-term moving average of ETH/BTC is above its long-term moving average
‚Üí This shows ETH is gaining strength relative to BTC

‚∏ª

‚ùå Exit Conditions ‚Äî Any One Is Enough

We exit the position as soon as any of the following exit conditions are met:
	1.	Trend Reversal Detected
‚Üí ETH price drops more than a threshold below its moving average
‚Üí Suggests a weakening trend
	2.	Stop-Loss Triggered
‚Üí Trade incurs a loss greater than -1.5%
‚Üí Protects against large unexpected drawdowns
	3.	Take-Profit Triggered
‚Üí Trade reaches +4% gain
‚Üí Locks in profits on sharp moves
	4.	Volume Anomaly Detected
‚Üí Unusually high volume (e.g. 6√ó average volume)
‚Üí But with a very small candle body (low price movement)
‚Üí Indicates potential hidden selling, exhaustion, or manipulation
‚Üí We exit to avoid unfavorable conditions

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

Please note that maximum drawdown (MaxDD) may be underestimated in this strategy.
This is because the stop-loss logic is based on the close of each 5-minute candle, and not on intrabar (tick-by-tick or second-level) data.

Since second-level historical data is not available, it‚Äôs impossible to detect price spikes or wicks that could have triggered a stop-loss mid-candle.
Therefore, in real-world conditions, the drawdown could be slightly higher than shown in the backtest.
